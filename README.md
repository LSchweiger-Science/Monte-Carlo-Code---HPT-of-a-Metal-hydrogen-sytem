# Monte-Carlo-Code---HPT-of-a-Metal-hydrogen-sytem

This is a 2D Monte Carlo code that models a 2-metal or 2-metal+hydrogen system subjected to high-pressure torsion (HPT), i.e. severe plastic deformation.
This allows to evaluate the impact of the hydrogen on the microstructure evolution during HPT. 

A Spyder File is given that contains the usable code, the MC simulation itself as well as the code for proper visualization and plotting.

Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook tutorial is given, explaining all the individual functions of the MC simulation in greater detail and with simple examples.
