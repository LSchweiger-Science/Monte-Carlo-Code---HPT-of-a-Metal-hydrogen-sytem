# Monte-Carlo-Code---HPT-of-a-Metal-hydrogen-sytem

This is a Monte Carlo code that simulates a simple 2D case of a 2-metal or 2-metal+hydrogen system subjected to high-pressure torsion (HPT), i.e. severe plastic deformation.
This allows to evaluate the impact of the hydrogen on the microstructure evolution during HPT.

A Spyder File is given that contains the usable code. A Jupyter Notebook Tutorial is given, explaining all the individual steps and function.
